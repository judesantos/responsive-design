              Anticipated to be complete in Summer of 2019, these modern and luxurious apartments will be filled with natural light and open floor plans.  Residents at Newhall Crossings will have the option to choose from 1, 2, and 3 bedroom units that range from 960sf to 1436sf. Units will be divided into 2 separate buildings with a common plaza in the center filled with trending shops and restaurants open to the public.  Conveniently placed next to a new 7-screen Laemmle Theatres, residents will be seconds away from seeing their favorite movie in the spur of the moment or participating in one of many events that will take place in the plaza.
            </p>
            <p>
              Situated on Main Street in the heart of Old Town Newhall in Santa Clarita, CA, residents will be steps away from local restaurants, shops, theatres, wineries, and breweries.  Enjoy the warm summer nights and weekly events such as “Revved Up” where you can feast your eyes on amazing classic cars or “Senses” that offers a selection of food trucks in a fun and festive adult setting.
